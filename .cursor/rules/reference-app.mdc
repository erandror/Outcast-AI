# Pocket Casts Reference App

## Location
The Pocket Casts iOS app source code is available locally at:
```
../references/pocket-casts-ios/
```

This is the official open-source iOS app from Automattic (https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-ios).

## Why Use It
Pocket Casts is a mature, production-quality podcast app with 1.7k+ GitHub stars and 15,000+ commits. Use it as a reference for:
- Audio playback patterns and AVFoundation usage
- Podcast feed parsing and data models
- Background audio and Now Playing integration
- SwiftUI + UIKit hybrid patterns
- Modular architecture for iOS apps

## Key Directories to Reference

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `podcasts/` | Main iOS app source code |
| `Modules/DataModel/` | Core data models and persistence |
| `Modules/Server/` | API and networking layer |
| `Modules/Utils/` | Shared utilities |
| `Pocket Casts Watch App/` | watchOS companion app |
| `WidgetExtension/` | Home screen widgets |
| `PodcastsIntents/` | Siri shortcuts integration |

## How to Use as Reference
When implementing a feature in Outcast, search the Pocket Casts codebase for similar functionality:
- Use `grep` or `codebase_search` scoped to `../references/pocket-casts-ios/`
- Look at their patterns, then adapt (don't copy) for our SwiftUI-first approach
- Their app uses both UIKit and SwiftUI; prefer SwiftUI patterns for Outcast

## Important Notes
- The reference code is NOT part of the Outcast project
- Do not copy code directly - use it for learning patterns and architecture
- The reference is excluded from `.cursorignore` to avoid polluting context
