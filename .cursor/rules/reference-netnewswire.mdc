# NetNewsWire Reference App

## Location
The NetNewsWire iOS/macOS app source code is available locally at:
```
../references/NetNewsWire/
```

This is the official open-source RSS reader from Ranchero Software (https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire).

## Why Use It
NetNewsWire is a mature, well-architected feed reader with 9.3k+ GitHub stars and MIT license. Use it as a reference for:
- Feed parsing (RSS, Atom, JSON Feed) - similar to podcast feed parsing
- SwiftUI + AppKit/UIKit patterns for iOS and macOS
- Modular Swift Package architecture
- Background refresh and sync
- Widget implementation
- iCloud sync patterns
- Clean, maintainable Swift code style

## Key Directories to Reference

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `iOS/` | iOS-specific app code |
| `Mac/` | macOS-specific app code |
| `Shared/` | Cross-platform shared code |
| `Modules/` | Swift packages for core functionality |
| `Widget/` | Home screen widget implementation |
| `Intents/` | Siri shortcuts integration |
| `Tests/` | Unit and integration tests |
| `Technotes/` | Architecture documentation |

## Relevant for Outcast
NetNewsWire is particularly useful for:
- **Feed Parsing**: RSS/Atom parsing is very similar to podcast RSS feeds
- **Refresh Logic**: Background fetch and update patterns
- **Data Models**: How to structure feed items, subscriptions
- **Sync**: iCloud and account sync patterns
- **Performance**: Efficient list rendering with large datasets

## How to Use as Reference
- Search with `grep` or `codebase_search` scoped to `../references/NetNewsWire/`
- Check the `Technotes/` folder for architecture decisions
- Look at `Modules/` for clean separation of concerns
- Their RSS parsing can inform podcast feed parsing

## Important Notes
- NetNewsWire targets both iOS and macOS - focus on `iOS/` for Outcast
- MIT licensed - more permissive than Pocket Casts (MPL-2.0)
- Very clean, readable Swift code - good style reference
- The reference is excluded from `.cursorignore` to avoid polluting context
